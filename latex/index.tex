Matrix indexes are 32-\/bit unsigned integers so matrix size is in practice limited by the amount of memory.~\newline
 This library manages full, sparse and symmetric matrices using as less memory as possible.~\newline
 Matrix elements can be of any data type.~\newline
 Matrices can be read from/written to disk in a compact binary format.~\newline
 Rows and columns may have names (any C++ string).~\newline
 The characteristics of a matrix can be known without loading it into memory.~\newline
 Rows and columns can be read from disk, either by their names or numbers, without loading the complete matrix in memory.~\newline
 ~\newline
 One example program is provided, jmat, which is a command-\/line interface that allows creation from/writing to jmatrices from CSV files, as long as any kind of matrix manipulation. See section Files.~\newline

 This library is used by ppamlib, a library to implement in parallel the Partiioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering method that can be found in \href{https://github.com/JdMDE/ppamlib}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Jd\+MDE/ppamlib}}~\newline
~\newline
 Its code with interface modifications is also used inside the jmatrix R package (\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jmatrix}{\texttt{ https\+://\+CRAN.\+R-\/project.\+org/package=jmatrix}})
