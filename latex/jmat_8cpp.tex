\doxysubsubsection*{jmat}

A program to manipulate matrices created with the jmatrix library and written to the disk as binary files.

The program must be called as \begin{DoxyVerb}jmat command matrix_file other_options -o out_matrix file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 where command is one of a predefined list (see below) which is followed by the matrix to be manipulated, other relevant options for the particular command and (optionally) the -\/o option with the result of the command.~\newline
If -\/o option is not given, the result is dumped to the console in ASCII~\newline
{\bfseries{other\+\_\+options}} are options dependent on the command (call \textquotesingle{}jmat any\+\_\+command\textquotesingle{} for specific information)~\newline
Also, remember that if this program is called as {\bfseries{jmatd}} (symbolic link to jmat) you will get debugging messages in the console.~\newline
~\newline
Possible commands are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}jmat info matrix_file [-o info_file.txt]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Dumps in ASCII to console or to info\+\_\+file.\+txt information about the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat rownum matrix_file n -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file with the n-\/th row of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file (index n from 0).

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat rownums matrix_file n1,n2,... -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file with the rows in the comma-\/sepparated list of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file (indices n1,n2,... from 0).

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat rowname matrix_file rname -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file with the row named \textquotesingle{}rname\textquotesingle{} of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file (index n from 0).

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat rownames matrix_file rn1,rn2,... -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file, with the rows named \textquotesingle{}rn1\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}rn2\textquotesingle{}... in the comma-\/sepparated list of the jmatrix n file matrix\+\_\+file.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat colnum matrix_file n -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file, with the n-\/th column of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file (index n from 0).

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat colnums matrix_file n1,n2,... -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file, with the columns in the comma-\/sepparated list of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file (indices form 0).

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat colname matrix_file cname -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file, with the column named \textquotesingle{}cname\textquotesingle{} of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat colnames matrix_file cn1,cn2,... -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file, with the columns named \textquotesingle{}cn1\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}cn2\textquotesingle{}... in the comma-\/sepparated list of the jmatrix in file matrix\+\_\+file.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat subdiag symmetric_matrix_file -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a jmatrix file with the lower-\/triangular part (not including the diagonal) of the symmetric matrix in the input.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat getrnames matrix_file -o res_file.txt
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Dumps to ASCII file res\+\_\+file.\+txt the names of the rows in the input matrix.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat getcnames matrix_file -o res_file.txt
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Dumps to ASCII file res\+\_\+file.\+txt the names of the columns in the input matrix.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat setrnames matrix_file rownames_file.txt -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a copy of the original jmatrix setting or changing the row names to those given in file rownames\+\_\+file.\+txt, which must have as many lines as rows in input matrix.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat setcnames matrix_file colnames_file.txt -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a copy of the original jmatrix setting or changing the column names to those given in file colnames\+\_\+file.\+txt, which must have as many lines as columns in input matrix.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat setrcnames matrix_file rownames_file.txt colnames_file.txt -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Creates a copy of the original jmatrix setting or changing the row and column names to those given in files rownames\+\_\+file.\+txt and colnames\+\_\+file.\+txt respectively, which must have as many lines as rows/columns in input matrix.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat csvdump matrix_file format -o res_file.csv
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Dumps the content of the matrix in the input file to the .csv output file. Format must be one of these strings\+:~\newline
 cn Comma as separator, row/column names not surrounded by double quotes.~\newline
 cq Comma as separator, row/column names surrounded by double quotes.~\newline
 tn Tab as separator, row/column names not surrounded by double quotes.~\newline
 tq Tab as separator, row/column names surrounded by double quotes.

\begin{DoxyVerb}jmat csvread input_file.csv sepchar mtype valtype -o res_file
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Reads the input file, which must be a csv file, and creates a binary jmatrix file with its content.~\newline
 sepchar must be c or t to indicate that the expected field separator will be a comma or a tab, respectively.~\newline
 mtype must be one of the strings \textquotesingle{}full\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}sparse\textquotesingle{}. Symmetric matrices cannot be read as such from a CSV file.~\newline
 valtype must be one of the strings \textquotesingle{}u8\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}s8\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}u16\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}s16\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}u32\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}s32\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}u64\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}s64\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}f\textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}d\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}ld\textquotesingle{}.~\newline
 These stands for unsigned/signed integers of 8,16,32 or 64 bits, float, double, or long double datatypes, respectively.
